## Data Visualization: World University Rankings

#### Portfolio Project
This is a portfolio project in Python using the [World University Rankings](https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings/2022). Its purpose was to gain insight about the most popular universities in the world by: 

- Quickly cleaning a messy data set (a thorough explanation of cleaning is not covered)
- Basic **data visualization** techniques using Matlibplot and Seaborn

The main goal was to show how to interpret data from basic **data visualization**.

#### Data Source
The dataset used can be downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/padhmam/qs-world-university-rankings-2017-2022). The original data was acquired (not by me) by scraping the QS World University Rankings website with Python and Selenium.

#### Information about the Data
QS World University Rankings is an annual publication of global university rankings by Quacquarelli Symonds. The QS ranking receives approval from the International Ranking Expert Group (IREG), and is viewed as one of the three most-widely read university rankings in the world. QS publishes its university rankings in partnership with Elsevier.

#### Ranking Methodology 
The set of [indicators](https://support.qs.com/hc/en-gb/articles/4405955370898-QS-World-University-Rankings) for the World University Ranking and their weights are:
- Academic Reputation (40%)
- Employer Reputation (10%)
- Faculty Student Ratio (20%)
- Citations per Faculty (20%)
- International Faculty Ratio (5%)
- International Student Ratio (5%)

For this project, Faculty Student Ratio, Citations per Faculty (or Research), and International Faculty and Student Ratios were analyzed.

Academic Repuation and Employer Reputation are *not* included in the Kaggle dataset. 

#### Notes
This project was created to show off some basic skills in Python. It is not meant to be a tutorial or any form of official anaylsis.
